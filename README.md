# AI based statistical analysis of land-use plastic pollution in India.

This project was accepted in **Microsoft AI For Earth Grant Program** where we received a grant prize of USD 15,000 worth of Azure credits.

## **Project Summary**

**Problem Statement**
•	The amount of Plastic Waste generated is increasing day by day.
•	In the Financial year 2019-2020 approximately 3.4 million tons of plastic waste was generated in India.
•	Most of the existing systems discuss the analysis of the amount of plastic waste generated in a specific area and fail to discuss the rate of growth and amount of plastic waste generation in the next few years.

**Proposed Solution**
•	This Project aims to gather information on the amount of plastic waste generated every year from various states, districts and cities.
•	With the help of Machine Learning model, proposed system will predict the amoun of plastic waste which would be generated in the following 10 years under similar circumstances and constraints.
•	Heatmaps are also generated to show the areas with low, moderate and high amouts of plastic waste and to depict details about recycling plants.

**This project's Research Paper is published under IJERA**
•	The paper discusses about the different ML/AI approaches we have implemented for the prediction of plastic waste in India in the next 5 years based on previous 10 years data. 
•	Data analysis is done with Heatmaps, Scatter plots, pie charts, line graphs and other graphs using PowerBI and Python plotly.
•	Results from each of the ML Algorithms are tabulated and compared based on several metrics like Relative Absolute Error, Relative Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Coefficient of Determination.
•	This paper has been published in IJERA, in June 2024.
